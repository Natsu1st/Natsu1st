        <h1>Mt. Everest (8,848 m) </h1>
        <p class="Paragraph">Climb Everest if you want to stand on top of the world, or do the extremely popular Everest Base Camp 
            Trek to enter a strange world of ice and snow.
            Reach the highest point on earth or choose to live out your dream by standing at the foot of Mt. Everest (8,848 m). 
            The Everest region in Nepal is more than just climbing and trekking, it is a life-changing experience and some see it 
            as a journey close to achieving Nirvana. Located in the northeastern province of Nepal, this region is in a world of 
            its own with vast glaciers, icefalls, the highest mountains, deep valleys, precarious settlements, and hardy people 
            challenging the harshest conditions thrown at them by nature in the thin air of high altitude.
           </p>

        <p class="Paragraph"> Passing through legendary Sherpa villages, the trek is a mix of deep cultural and spiritual experiences and physical 
            challenges that test your strength and endurance. Buddhist lamas, monks and nuns led by Rinpoches (reincarnate at mas)
             serve the predominantly Sherpa communities from their gompas (monasteries).          
            The journey to Everest or Everest Base Camp begins with a dramatic flight from Kathmandu to Lukla, after which you hike 
            up the Everest region to reach your destination in the Himalayas. However, for die-hard lovers of trekking, there is another
             switchback starting from Jiri through the mid-hills of Solu, an ethnically diverse section of the trek rich </p>

            </div> 
       
       
        <p>For those with sufficient time, a 10-12 day trek through Solu to the Khumbu and the Sagarmatha National Park is an excellent itinerary both in terms of acclimatization and to observe the changing customs, traditions, and lifestyles as you go from the lower altitude settlements to those in the higher altitudes.

            A part of the Himalayan ecological zone, the park was added to the list of UNESCO Natural World Heritage Sites in 1979. The park has three of the world's highest mountains: Everest, Lhotse, and Cho Oyu besides countless other peaks that rise above 6,000 meters from sea level.
            
            Taking a flight is a time-saver, while trekking from Jiri gives you the opportunity to follow in the footsteps of Tenzing and Hillary before their conquest of Everest. With more time to interact with the charming people along the route, you get to see the rich flora and fauna on the long trail. You get the added benefit of natural acclimatization as you go up and down the cliffs and valleys.
            
            The option from Jiri will roughly add 10 days to your trip to the famous Sherpa village, Namche Bazaar (3,500m). The Sagarmatha National Park in which Mt. Everest lies is one of the few places on earth with the rarest bio-diversity and the highest mountains in the world.
