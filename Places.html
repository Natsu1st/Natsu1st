        <h1>Kathmandu Vallay</h1>
        <p class="Paragraph">Kathmandu Valley comprises the three ancient cities of Kathmandu, 
            Patan and Bhaktapur, which were once independent states ruled by the Malla kings from
             the 12th to the 18th centuries. The three cities house seven UNESCO World Heritage shrines 
             which are together listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site (Culture). The valley is also 
             home to hundreds of other exquisite monuments, sculptures, artistic temples and magnificent 
             art - reminders of the golden era in Nepal’s architecture. </p>

        <p class="Paragraph">  Legend has it that the valley was once a primordial lake ringed by 
            verdant mountains.  In this pristine lake lived giant serpents until one fine day, saint
             Manjushree, the Bodhisatva, raised a mighty sword and in one fell swoop, cut open the side
              of a mountain at a place now known as Chobar. The voluminous water of the lake gushed out,
               leaving behind a fertile valley capable of supporting large urban settlements over the millennia.
                The Gopala and Kirati dynasties were the earliest rulers here followed by the Licchavi (300-879 A.D.),
                 under whom flourished trade and crafts. </p>

        <p>But the valley’s remarkable cities with their ornate palaces, 
            the superbly crafted pagodas, and the monumental stupas are testimony of
             the artistic genius of the Newars, the original inhabitants of the valley, 
             whose skills were championed by the Malla kings and appreciated even by 
             the Mongol rulers of 18th century China.
        </p>
        <h2>CLIMATE </h2>  
        <p>Kathmandu Valley is blessed by a temperate climate. The temperature does not exceed 34 degrees Celsius even during
            the scorching summer months and does not drop below 3 degrees Celsius in winter.
        </p>      
        <h2>ACCESS/ ACCOMMODATION </h2>
        <p>One can directly fly into the Tribhuvan International Airport in the Kathmandu Valley. 
            One can ride buses or drive to Kathmandu from border towns and other parts of the
             country. There are five-star hotels, resorts to moderate accommodations with modern
              amenities available in and around Kathmandu Valley.
